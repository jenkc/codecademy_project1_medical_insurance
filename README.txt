Codecademy Data Science Portfolio Project 1: Medical Insurance

First portfolio project for the Codeacademy Data Science Career Path
    
Repo includes:
    README.txt      contents and tasks
    insurance.csv   .csv file provided by Codecademy
    project1.ipynb  Jupyter Notebook
    project1.py     Python 3.7.3 script

Tasks:
    Look over your dataset
        Open insurance.csv and take a look at the file
    Scoping your project
        My analysis ideas:
        Demographics:
          - average age of all patients
          - aveage age of female and average age of male patients
          - most common region reported by patients
          - percentage of patients who are smokers
          - percentage of female patients and percentage of male patients who are smokers
        Comparisons: 
          - compare average costs for smokers to that of non-smokers
            (with no children, to remove that variable from the analysis)
          - compare average BMI of female patients with children to average BMI of female patients without children
    Import your dataset
        - Import insurance.csv into your Python file  
        - Make sure the information is easy to access
    Save your dataset via Python variables
        - Organize the information from insurance.csv in variables that can be used for analysis
    Buid out analysis functions or class methods
        - Use Python fundamentals to accomplish these tasks
        - I chose to build a class that contains methods for the analysis
